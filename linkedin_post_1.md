**British Gift of Gab Elements:**

## 📝 THE POST (Copy This)

```
Right, confession time.

I've spent the past three months building something that probably nobody asked for.

An end-to-end AI platform for car insurance pricing.

"Masood, why on earth would you do that?"

Fair question.

It seems like every data science portfolio has the same Titanic dataset, the same iris flowers, the same predictive models that'll never see production.

I wanted something different.

Something an actual InsurTech would need to deploy tomorrow.

So I built it. The whole thing:

🤖 6 ML models competing (CatBoost won — AUC 0.6176)
🔍 Fraud detection with NLP and network analysis
💰 Actuarial pricing engine with Monte Carlo simulation
💎 Customer lifetime value prediction
🧠 SHAP explainability (because regulators aren't optional)
📡 Production REST API doing 500 requests/second
📊 Interactive dashboard with 10 analytical pages

The projected numbers?

→ £2.06M annual benefit
→ 8.4% profit margin (industry averages 5-7%)
→ £60M fraud savings potential

Now, I'm rather pleased with how it turned out.

But here's what I'm genuinely curious about:

If you were building an insurance AI platform from scratch — what would you prioritise first?

The models? The explainability? The API? The business case?

I'd love to know what you think matters most.

3. Use "That's a brilliant point" or "You've hit on something there"

**If someone disagrees:**
- "It sounds like you've seen this done differently — what's worked for you?"
- Never defend, always explore
